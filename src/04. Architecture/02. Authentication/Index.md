# Authentication

Piranha doesn't really care **how** your users gets authenticated, whether it's the end users of your application or the administrators accessing the manager interface. Instead, Piranha uses a claims based security model to check what the current user has access to.

We provide two different packages for handling authentication, one for development and one for production scenarios.

To read more about how the implement custom authentication services for your application, please refer to [Authentication](../extensions/authentication) under the Extensions section.

## Adding Permissions

Besides the claims used by the default pages in the manager interface you can add custom claims for you application, both for custom manager pages **or** for securing pages in your application.

### Adding Application Claims

The application claims you add will be available when you edit and set up **Roles** in the manager if you're using the `Identity` package. These claims will also be available in the settings for your Pages & Posts and can be used for securing certain instances of your content. This should be added in your `Startup.cs`.

~~~ csharp
App.Permissions["Application"].Add(new Piranha.Security.PermissionItem
{
    Name = "WebUser",
    Title = "Web User"
});
~~~

The first name is the main category you want to group your permissions in and can be anything you like. In this example we've choosen the name "Application".

### Adding Manager Claims

Manager claims works in the same way as application claims, the only difference is that you set the property `IsInternal` to `true`. By doing this they are not shown when specifying permissions for your public pages & posts and should only be used when validating if the current manager should have access to something in the manager interface.

~~~ csharp
App.Permissions["Application"].Add(new Piranha.Security.PermissionItem
{
    Category = "My Manager Feature",
    Name = "EditStuff",
    Title = "Edit Stuff",
    IsInternal = true
});
App.Permissions["Application"].Add(new Piranha.Security.PermissionItem
{
    Category = "My Manager Feature",
    Name = "DeleteStuff",
    Title = "Delete Stuff",
    IsInternal = true
});
~~~
